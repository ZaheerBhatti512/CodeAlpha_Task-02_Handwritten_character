🎙️ Emotion Recognition from Speech using Deep Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on recognizing human emotions from speech audio using deep learning. The model is trained to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, calm, fearful, disgust, surprised, and neutral.
By combining speech signal processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system can analyze voice recordings and predict the underlying emotions.

🎯 Objectives

Extract meaningful audio features from speech data.

Train a deep learning model to classify human emotions.

Explore real-world applications of emotion recognition in AI.

⚙️ Approach

Dataset

Used the RAVDESS dataset, which contains emotional speech recordings.

Feature Extraction

Extracted MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) from audio signals.

Padded/truncated features for uniform input length.

Model

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with:

Convolution + Pooling layers

Dropout for regularization

Dense layers for classification

Optimized with Adam and categorical crossentropy loss.

Training & Evaluation

Split dataset into training and testing sets.

Achieved strong accuracy in predicting emotions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Librosa – Audio processing

NumPy, Pandas – Data handling

TensorFlow/Keras – Deep learning

Scikit-learn – Preprocessing & evaluation

Matplotlib – Visualization

📊 Results

Successfully trained a CNN model to classify 8 different emotions.

Visualized training and validation accuracy/loss.

Demonstrated that speech signals contain strong emotional cues that AI can detect.

💡 Applications

Virtual assistants that understand user emotions.

Healthcare systems to detect stress or depression.

Call center analytics for customer satisfaction.

Human-computer interaction with empathy.

🔮 Future Work

Implementing RNN/LSTM models for temporal learning.

Real-time emotion recognition from live audio streams.

Expanding to multilingual datasets.
